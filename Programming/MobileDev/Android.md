#### Simple Links
  * [Developer Training with various builds](http://developer.android.com/training/index.html)
  * [UML for developing an app](http://developer.android.com/tools/workflow/index.html)
  * [Android Developer Blog](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/)

#### What to use to create the apps
* [Eclipse IDE + ADT Plugin](http://dl.google.com/android/installer_r23.0.2-windows.exe): If you already use the Eclipse IDE, this is a plugin which can be downloaded for **Windows** and can be used to create android apps. 
**Verdict: Pretty Slow**
* [Eclipse ADT](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#win-bundle):  It includes the essential Android SDK components and a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools) to streamline your Android app development.
**Verdict: Slow**
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html): Android Studio is a new Android development environment based on IntelliJ IDEA. **Verdict: Beta but Efficient**

There are three steps for the perfect app: **[Design](http://developer.android.com/design/index.html "Android Dev. Design Home")** --> **[Develop](http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html  "Android Dev. Develop Home")** --> **[Distribute](http://developer.android.com/distribute/index.html  "Android Dev. Distribute Home")**
