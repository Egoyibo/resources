Getting Started with Python
============================

So you wanna learn python eh? Well, what is python? Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C. 

>"Python has been built up over the decades and, being an open source language, a lot of this has been released for others to use. Almost all of it is collected on https://pypi.python.org, pronounced “pie-pee-eye” or, more commonly called “the CheeseShop”."--[Team Tree House](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/what-is-python)

If you wanna dive straight into the syntax, dive into #1[Team Tree House's](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/python-basics/upcoming) online interactive tool for learning. If you wanna start from scratch and work through the entire thing begin with [Learning Python from Scratch](http://code.tutsplus.com/series/python-from-scratch--net-20566). If you're really a rebel, [do it the hard way.](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

### An Introduction to Python
[Python By Team Tree House](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/python-basics/upcoming) | If you're new to Python, this is the place to start. In this course, you'll take a look at some of the most common and important bits of the language, how to use them, and then put them together into several different handy scripts. Finally, you'll build a small console game using all of the stuff you've learned!
[Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) | In this Codecademy course you will learn how to work with files, how to use loops and how they work, what are functions and what they’re good for. It’s all very basic, and very beginner friendly. There is community forums available for those who need help, but usually everything can be understood from within the dashboard you’re working with.
[Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) | The absolute easiest way of learning Python is by completing this book. You’ll be amazed at how easy it is to pickup the basics, and you get that sense of real learning process, acquiring new knowledge as you move forward. I also learned that it is very encouraging to try and create your own programs.
[Learning Python from Scratch](http://code.tutsplus.com/series/python-from-scratch--net-20566) | This is going to teach you the ins and outs of Python development... from scratch. There's no need to worry if you don't have any ounce of Python experience. 
[A Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/) | Very similar to Learn Python The Hard Way, but offers a slightly more in-depth introduction on how to get your perfect setup up and running, and how to take the first steps so you don’t overwhelm yourself. It has been recognized as one of the best beginner guides for those who want to learn Python, definitely check it out and see the first few chapters to figure out whether you like the style of writing.
[The New Boston](https://buckysroom.org/videos.php?cat=98) | If you’re more like someone who likes to learn from video tutorials, I’m not sure there is anything as comprehensive as The New Boston video tutorial series for learning Python, and many other programming languages as can be seen on their YouTube channel. If you want some of their older python videos after you're done, check [here](https://buckysroom.org/videos.php?cat=36)
[Python + Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1) | This course is intended for people who have never programmed before. A knowledge of grade school mathematics is necessary: you need to be comfortable with simple mathematical equations, including operator precedence. You should also be comfortable working with simple functions, such as f(x) = x + 5.

It should be completed with ten weeks, spending around ten hours of work on the tasks each week. If you’re able to find the time to do it, and not overwhelm yourself – do it.
[The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) | It might be a little tricky to get this one going, if you’ve never in your life programmed before, but it goes together well with the above book, and you should definitely give it a go. There are 33 levels (puzzles), which can be solved by using your Python programming skills.
[Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) | Google itself is powered by a lot of Python code, and so it only makes sense that they support the community and want to help others learn the language. This is one of my favorite guides / classes I’ve ever viewed, it’s really detailed and the videos are very beginner friendly and also entertaining to watch.
[Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) | Think Python is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters. You can even find some example code[here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/code/)
