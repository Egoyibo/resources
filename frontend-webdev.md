Frontend Web Dev Resources 
===============================

## Intro
Web Development, "is a mix of programming and layout that powers the visuals and interactions of the web."--[Nick Schaden](https://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-front-end-web-development/)

[Code Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au-8f__TLXEddGlHSFFhZG1TcnIwaFdxZVVVcXhxN3c&usp=sharing): Used to reference different things you can implement in your code, so that you donâ€™t have to google how to do everything. (Please feel free to edit, revise, and add as well)



1. First things first, what are you going to code in? Before coding, you must download a **text editor**! This allows you to write code that will then be readable by browsers. (_The following text editors are ordered in my preference_)

    1. [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) | a text editor made for web developers, in javascript. I think its awesome. 
    2. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) | I love the colors, and the vast amount of languages it works for | works for all the following web dev. languages *RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS* If you do decide to pick sublime, I recommend downloading two important packages that will streamline your coding: Emmet and SFTP. 
    3. [Atom](https://atom.io/) | Made by GitHub, an open source text editor, there is a lot of potential for customizibility
    4. [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) | Vim, is a very old but highly robust editor.
    5. Text Wrangler (Mac App)
    6. Notepad / Notepad ++
