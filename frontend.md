## Intro
Web Development, "is a mix of programming and layout that powers the visuals and interactions of the web."--[Nick Schaden](https://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-is-front-end-web-development/)

1. First things first, what are you going to code in? Before coding, you must download a **text editor**! This allows you to write code that will then be readable by browsers. (_The following text editors are ordered in my preference_)

    1. [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) | a text editor made for web developers, in javascript. I think its awesome. 
    2. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) | I love the colors, and the vast amount of languages it works for | works for all the following web dev. languages *RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS* If you do decide to pick sublime, I recommend downloading two important packages that will streamline your coding: Emmet and SFTP. 
    3. [Atom](https://atom.io/) | Made by GitHub, an open source text editor, there is a lot of potential for customizibility
    4. Vim |
    5. Text Wrangler (Mac App)
    6. Notepad / Notepad ++
